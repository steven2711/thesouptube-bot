```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your Twitter API credentials:
   - Create a Twitter Developer account and create a new app
   - Copy your API keys and tokens
   - Create a `config/config.js` file with your credentials:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     consumer_key: "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY",
     consumer_secret: "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET",
     access_token: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",

     strictSSL: true,
   };
   ```

## Usage

Start the bot:
```bash
npm start
```

The bot will automatically:
- Post movie trivia at 8 AM daily
- Follow relevant users based on configured keywords
- Manage following/follower relationships
- Unfollow accounts that don't follow back after a certain period

### Customization

You can modify the following parameters in `functions.js`:

```javascript
let dailyKeywords = [
  "drunk commentary",
  "drunk",
  "party animal",
  "terrible movie"
];
```

Adjust follower criteria in the `filterUsers` function:
```javascript
const criteria = {
  followers_count: 1000,  // Minimum followers
  statuses_count: 100,    // Minimum tweets
  following: false,       // Not already following
  follow_request_sent: false  // No pending requests
};
```

## Configuration

The bot can be configured through several timing constants in `index.js`:

```javascript
const thirtyMinutes = 1800000;
const fiveMinutes = 300000;
const hour = 3600000;
const fiveHour = 18000000;
const twoHour = 7200000;
const threeHour = 10800000;
```

You can adjust these values to change the frequency of various operations.
